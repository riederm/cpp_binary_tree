# C++ Binary Tree Example

This project demonstrates a simple binary tree implementation in C++ using raw pointers.

Try to improve this code with the help of smart pointers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., g++ 7+) (or better, use the devcontainer)
- `make` utility

### Build
```
make
```

### Run
```
./binary_tree
```

### Clean
```
make clean
```

## Development Container
A `.devcontainer` is provided for VS Code users. Open the folder in a dev container for a ready-to-use C++ environment.
